# Pauser
## Problem
In GTA 5 Online, the following problem very often arises: when leaving a mission or moving to another session, the connection to the session is made for an infinitely long time.

## Solutions
From the side of the player, you can take the following actions:
 * Pause the game process via resmon.exe or a non-standard task manager.
 *Temporarily disconnect the network cable.
 
## Goal
Perform these actions with one button.

##  Results
With this tool you can

Select available network adapters and disable/enable them programmatically without physically affecting the network cable, thus avoiding damage to the cable connectors.
Select running processes on machine by name and pause/resume all them at once without having to search for every process.
Combine the above operations into a one-button sequence.
